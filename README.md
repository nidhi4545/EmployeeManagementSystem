# Employee Management System
I have created this simple Employee Management System using Java so as to better understand the principles of data encapsulation, classes and objects, exception handling.

I have 4 classes in the src package and have tried to separate them into layers of model which is the base class, service layer, api and the main class.

This project was done in the hopes to expand my portfolio.
